## Background and dataset
Project 2 is an extension of the first project with Bash command-line tool built in that perform a useful data preparation task. The dataset employed is from Kaggle, which oulines the historical stock data for all current S&P 500 companies. This dataset include data up to Feb 2018. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500).

In fiancial worlds, people are not only interested in finding out the rate of return of a stock. Moreover, investors can reduce investment risks through diversification, and portfolio risk can be reduced by holding instruments that are not perfectly correlated. Therefore, in project 2, I'm trying to calculate the correlation coefficient between 2 stocks to provide insights into their return movements over time.

## More to come!
More financial analysis about this S&P 500 stock dataset such as correlation matrix including more than 2 stocks, correlation coefficient with the average market reutn, and more advanced portfolio selection command will be updated sooner...
